## sofa-spm: Sofa Package Manager.
Tired of installing Sofa plugin manually or locate which component is in which plugin ? Try sofa-spm.

sofa-spm is a small tool to search for plugins or components & install them with their dependencies  
with as few as possible steps. 


### Install
You can install sofa-spm by simply using pip and by typing:
```console
   pip install sofa-spm
```

At this point it is recommended to retrieve the most recent list of sofa packages available. 
This can be done by typing:
```console
   sofa-spm.py upgrade
```

### Usage
sofa-spm use ssh based authentication to access the plugin respositories so you need to have configured your ssh 
account on the relevant services (github.com/gitlab.inria.fr/etc...).

It is possible to get a list of the available plugins with the *list* command:
```console
dmarchal@dmarchal-Precision-7520:~/projects/DEFROST/dev/spm/test$ sofa-spm.py list
 Defrost:
      ModelOrderReduction.sp
      SoftRobots.Inverse.sp
      STLIB.sp
      DefrostAllPlugins.sp
      BeamAdapter.sp
      SoftRobots.sp
      sofa-shells.sp
  Defrost/Robots:
      Echelon3.sp
      SOFIA.sp
  Consortium:
      HighOrder.sp
      SofaQtQuick.sp
  Mimesis:
      DepthSense.sp
      Meshless.sp
      SofaOR.sp
```

You can also search for plugins which contains specific components with the *search* command:
```console
dmarchal@dmarchal-Precision-7520:~/projects/DEFROST/dev/spm/test$ sofa-spm.py search CableActuator
The Sofa Package Manager
- searching for 'CableActuator' in 7 plugins descriptions. Found:
  SoftRobots                      A plugin dedicated to SoftRobotics.
```

In case no exact matches are found for the *search* command an approximated search is performed which provides 
you suggestions:
```console
dmarchal@dmarchal-Precision-7520:~/projects/DEFROST/dev/spm/test$ sofa-spm.py search CableActutor
The Sofa Package Manager
- searching for 'CableActutor' in 7 plugins descriptions. No exact match...but I found:
  CableActuator                    (get details by typing: 'spm search CableActuator')
```

Finally, when you have found the plugins you want to install you can use the *install* command:
```console
dmarchal@dmarchal-Precision-7520:~/projects/DEFROST/dev/spm/test$ sofa-spm.py install SofaQtQuick SoftRobots.Inverse 
The Sofa Package Manager
- instal list is ['SofaQtQuick', 'STLIB', 'SoftRobots', 'SoftRobots.Inverse']
 - installing 'SofaQtQuick' (destination path ./)
   cloning from: git@github.com:sofa-framework/SofaQtQuick.git
Repository: ./SofaQtQuick skipped, already registered
 - installing 'STLIB' (destination path ./)
   cloning from: git@github.com:SofaDefrost/STLIB.git
Repository: ./STLIB skipped, already registered
 - installing 'SoftRobots' (destination path ./)
   cloning from: git@github.com:SofaDefrost/SoftRobots.git
Repository: ./SoftRobots skipped, already registered
 - installing 'SoftRobots.Inverse' (destination path ./)
   cloning from: git@github.com:SofaDefrost/SoftRobots.git
Repository: ./SoftRobots.Inverse skipped, already registered
 - building CMakeLists.txt for: ./
 - scanning directory ./ for plugins.
 - scanning directory ./ for plugins to generate mu-repo.
```

The 'install' command of spm will install the plugins but also all their dependencies.
The source for installation is the git official repository, these official repositories are renamed as 
"upstream" remotes. 
The install command also:
- generates a dependency friendly ordered CMakeLists.txt for direct integration in you SOFA_EXTERNAL_PLUGINS_DIRECTORY. 
- configure the plugins repository to be used with mu-repo (http://fabioz.github.io/mu-repo/).


## How to contribute & TODO
- Reports problems,
- Make PR to add your plugins into the plugin database. 
- Make suggestions on how to handle stuff like other remotes, binary distribution of plugins, private plugin management...
